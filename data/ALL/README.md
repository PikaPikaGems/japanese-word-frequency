# ALL — Consolidated Word Frequency Rankings

This folder merges Japanese word frequency rankings from multiple sources into unified CSVs.

## Files

## categorized.csv

Same columns as `consolidated.csv`, but each rank value is replaced with a vocabulary tier number:

| Value | Tier | Rank Range | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `5` | basic | 1–1,000 | Foundational and essential vocabulary |
| `4` | common | 1,001–4,000 | Frequent in everyday speech and writing |
| `3` | fluent | 4,001–10,000 | Expansive vocabulary for natural expression |
| `2` | advanced | 10,001–25,000 | Formal, academic, technical or specialized |
| `1` | rare | 25,001+ or not in source | Archaic, obscure, uncommon, invalid, or absent |

## Regenerating

```bash
python data/ALL/SCRIPT.py            # produces consolidated.csv
python data/ALL/CATEGORIZED.py       # produces categorized.csv
python data/ALL/add_kana_columns.py  # adds hiragana/katakana columns to all anchor CSVs
python data/ALL/fix_pure_kana_gaps.py  # fills pure-kana words that are their own reading
```

## Kana reading coverage

Reading lookup is built from two sources (280k entries combined):

| Source | Reading format | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| `data/JPDBV2/jpdb_v2.2_freq_list_2024-10-13.csv` | hiragana | primary |
| `data/CEJC/2_cejc_frequencylist_suw_token.tsv` | katakana | fallback |

Coverage after lookup + pure-kana fill (categorized and consolidated are identical):

| Anchor | Words | Missing reading | % missing |
|--------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| CEJC | 27,987 | 0 | 0.0% |
| JPDB | 24,231 | 0 | 0.0% |
| ANIME_JDRAMA | 25,000 | 2,636 | 10.5% |
| NETFLIX | 25,000 | 1,728 | 6.9% |
| YOUTUBE_FREQ_V3 | 30,000 | 1,935 | 6.5% |

Remaining gaps are almost entirely conjugated verb forms (`会える`, `行ける`, `使える`) and proper nouns/names (`悟`, `宮近`, `中村`). Non-Japanese tokens are negligible (1 across all files: `々`, the kanji repetition mark).
